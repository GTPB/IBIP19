    "Independently whether you <ins>want to re-analyze public data</ins> or <ins>get data from a core facility</ins>, you need a minimum of information do further process them, and _much more information_ to fully understand the data.\n",

    "So what do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "- files at different stages (raw spectra, identifications, quantified peptides and proteins)\n",
    "- detailed anotation of the files to relate them with the experimental design\n",
    "- detailed description of the data analysis to reproduce the results and check whether they were processed correctly\n",
