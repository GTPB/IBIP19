# 1\. Variation Analysis

In the [previous chapter](novel_peptides.md), novel peptides were
identified by Johansson *et al.* [(1)](#references) using a
proteogenomic search strategy. In addition, this search allowed
identifying peptides presenting single amino acid variants (SAAV).
Figure 7h displays the intensity of peptides produced by the reference
and alternative alleles of corresponding SNPs for each genotype.
