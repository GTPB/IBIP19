# 1\. Variation Analysis

In the [previous chapter](novel_peptides.md), novel peptides were
identified by Johansson *et al.* [(1)](#references) using a
proteogenomic search strategy. In addition, this search allowed
identifying peptides presenting single amino acid variants (SAAV).
Figure 7h displays the intensity of peptides produced by the reference
and alternative alleles of corresponding SNPs for each genotype.

##### [:thought\_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-if-we-assume-a-linear-relationship-between-number-of-alleles-and-peptide-abundance-what-should-be-the-distribution-of-intensities) *If we assume a linear relationship between number of alleles and peptide abundance, what should be the distribution of intensities?*

Note that the genotyping data corresponding to the peptide intensities
were not made available, but more examples can be found in
[Supplementary Figure

##### :speech\_balloon: Do the results presented follow a linear trend? What can affect the linearity of this relationship?
