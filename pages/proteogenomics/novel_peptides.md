# 1. Novel Peptides

Mutations in the genome can alter the sequence so that non-coding sections become coding. _e.g._ through the introduction of a start codon or the alteration of a stop codon. In order to identify these non-canonical genomic products, protein databases that capture genetic variation and non-canonical genomic products are generated either by enriching canonical protein sequences or by running six reading frame translation of the entire genome [(1)](#references).

## Data set

In this tutorial, we will analyze the non-canonical genomic products identified in breast cancer by Johansson _et al._ [(2)](#references). Note that this tutorial does not cover the database generation, search, and validation of identification results. These bioinformatic procedures are very demanding and we strongly advise to make sure that they are in place at your lab or at the facility processing the data before conducting any proteogenomic experiment. The proteogenomic identification results by Johansson _et al._ [(2)](#references) are reported in Supplementary Data 6, available [here](../resources/Johansson_et_al_breast_cancer_quantitative_proteome_and_proteogenomic_landscape) in the course repository.
