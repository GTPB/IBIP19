# RNA-Protein

In the [*novel peptides*](novel_peptides.md) and [*variatoin
analysis*](variation_analysis.md) chapters, novel and variant peptides
were identified by Johansson *et al.* [(1)](#references) using a
proteogenomic search strategy, where genomic data are used to inform the
proteomics search strategy. It is possible to use RNA sequencing data
complementarily or instead of the genetic sequence to identify
non-canonical protein products.

##### [:thought\_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-if-we-assume-a-linear-relationship-between-number-of-alleles-and-peptide-abundance-what-should-be-the-peptide-distribution-for-each-genotype) *What are the advantages and shortcomings of using transcript sequences instead of or in addition to genomic data?*
