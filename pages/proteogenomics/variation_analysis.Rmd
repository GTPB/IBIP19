# 1. Variation Analysis

In the [previous chapter](novel_peptides.md), novel peptides were identified by Johansson _et al._ [(1)](#references) using a proteogenomic search strategy. In addition, this search allowed identifying peptides presenting single amino acid variants (SAAV). Figure 7h displays the intensity of peptides produced by the reference and alternative alleles of corresponding SNPs for each genotype.

##### [:thought_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-based-on-you-knowledge-of-peptide-and-protein-identification-can-you-anticipate-challenges-posed-by-these-proteogenomic-databases) _If we assume a linear relationship between number of alleles and peptide abundance, what should be the distribution of intensities?_
