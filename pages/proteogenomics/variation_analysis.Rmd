# 1. Variation Analysis

In the [previous chapter](novel_peptides.md), novel peptides were identified by Johansson _et al._ [(1)](#references) using a proteogenomic search strategy. In addition, this search allowed identifying peptides presenting single amino acid variants (SAAV). 


## Libraries

We will need the following libraries, please make sure that they are installed.

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(gamlss)
library(conflicted)

theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 11))

## Genotype - peptide abundance relationship

Figure 7h displays the intensity of peptides produced by the reference and alternative alleles of corresponding SNPs for each genotype.

##### [:thought_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-if-we-assume-a-linear-relationship-between-number-of-alleles-and-peptide-abundance-what-should-be-the-peptide-distribution-for-each-genotype) _If we assume a linear relationship between number of alleles and peptide abundance, what should be the peptide distribution for each genotype?_

Note that the genotyping data corresponding to the peptide intensities were not made available, but more examples can be found in [Supplementary Figure 15](../resources/Johansson_et_al_breast_cancer_quantitative_proteome_and_proteogenomic_landscape/supplementary_information.pdf).

##### :speech_balloon: Do the results presented follow a linear trend? What can affect the linearity of the relationship between number of alleles and intensity distribution? 


## Abundance of variant peptides relative to the proteins

In [Supplementary Table 1](../resources/Johansson_et_al_breast_cancer_quantitative_proteome_and_proteogenomic_landscape) and [Supplementary Table 6](../resources/Johansson_et_al_breast_cancer_quantitative_proteome_and_proteogenomic_landscape), the authors provide the results of their proteogenomic analysis for genes and for peptides carrying alternative alleles of SAAVs, respectively. In addition, [Supplementary Table 1](../resources/Johansson_et_al_breast_cancer_quantitative_proteome_and_proteogenomic_landscape) contains experimental design and sample characterization information. The tables were extracted to an R-friendly text format for this tutorial, and are available in [resources/data/tumor.gz](resources/data/tumor.gz), [resources/data/proteins.gz](resources/data/proteins.gz), and [resources/data/saav.gz](resources/data/saav.gz).

##### :pencil2: Load the data in R as in the code below.

```{r import}

tumorDF <- read.table(
    file = "resources/data/tumor.gz",
    header = T,
    sep = "\t",
    comment.char = "",
    quote = "",
    stringsAsFactors = F
)

genesDF <- read.table(
    file = "resources/data/genes.gz",
    header = T,
    sep = "\t",
    comment.char = "",
    quote = "",
    stringsAsFactors = F
) %>%
    select(
        -contains("nspsm")
    )

saavDF <- read.table(
    file = "resources/data/saav.gz",
    header = T,
    sep = "\t",
    comment.char = "",
    quote = "",
    stringsAsFactors = F
)

```

Note that for the sake of speed, the last columns of the genes table were skipped.

##### [:thought_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-how-do-we-need-to-transform-the-tables-to-compare-saav-peptide-level-intensities-to-gene-level-intensities) _How do we need to transform the tables to compare SAAV peptide-level intensities to gene-level intensities?_

For the sake of time, this data transformation was run for you already. The proposed solution is available in [scripts/merge_table_1_6.R](resources/data/saav.gz), and the reformated SAAV peptides table is available in [resources/data/table16.gz](resources/data/table16.gz). Note that in this table one row represents a unique _{peptide sequence, gene accession}_ pair.

##### [:thought_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-why-can-there-be-multiple-peptide-per-gene-and-gene-per-peptide-is-it-correct-to-represent-peptides-by-their-sequence) _Why can there be multiple peptide per gene, and gene per peptide? Is it correct to represent peptides by their sequence?_

In the following, we want to compare the abundances associated to SAAV peptides to the abundances aggregated at the gene-level. For each tumor, we will therefore only retain quantified _{peptide, gene}_ pairs.

##### :pencil2: Load the reformated SAAV peptides table.

```{r import_table16}

# Load the table

saavDF <- read.table(
    file = "resources/data/table16.gz",
    header = T,
    sep = "\t",
    comment.char = "",
    quote = "",
    stringsAsFactors = F
)


# Place holder for column names

tumorPeptideColumns <- paste0(tumorDF$tumor_id, "_saavPeptide")
tumorGeneColumns <- paste0(tumorDF$tumor_id, "_gene")
tumorColumns <- c(tumorPeptideColumns, tumorGeneColumns)


# For each tumor, keep only pairs of gene and peptide pairs

for (tumor in tumorDF$tumor_id) {
    
    peptideColumn <- paste0(tumor, "_saavPeptide")
    geneColumn <- paste0(tumor, "_gene")
    
    saavDF[[peptideColumn]][is.na(saavDF[[geneColumn]])] <- NA
    saavDF[[geneColumn]][is.na(saavDF[[peptideColumn]])] <- NA

##### [:thought_balloon:](answers.md#thought_balloon-why-are-all-intensities-at-the-bottom-how-can-we-better-visualize-these-distributions) _Why are all intensities at the bottom? How can we better visualize these distributions?_

As you can see, the gene-level intensities are centered around one, and not for the peptide-level. You might have noticed in the paper that the gene-level data as provided in the supplementary information are centered, but this was not done for the peptides.

##### :speech_balloon: In your opinion why were the protein data centered? How would you recommend normalizing these data? Why?

Here, we hypothesize that SAAV peptides are sampled from these genes and should therefore present the same abundance distribution. Data acquisition and processing artefacts can influence the centering and scaling. To correct for this, we will normalize the abundances from all tumors using centile-based Z-scores.

```{r normalization}

# Iterate through the tumor columns

for (column in tumorColumns) {
    
    
    # Create a column name for the z-score transformed variables
    
    zColumn <- paste0("z_", column)
    
    
    # Create a data frame with only the columns of interest and filter out NA, zero, and infinite values
    
    trainingDF <- saavDF %>%
        select(
            gene, peptide_sequence, !!column
        ) %>%
        filter(
            !is.na(!!sym(column)) & !is.infinite(!!sym(column)) & !!sym(column) > 0
        )
    
    
    # Train the model
    
    trainingDF$x <- 0 # Note that it is possible to include covariates in the model instead of using a constant here
    
    model <- gamlss(
        formula = as.formula(paste0(column, " ~ x")),
        family = LOGNO,
        data = trainingDF,
        
    )
    
    
    # Compute the z-scores
    
    trainingDF[[zColumn]] <- centiles.pred(
        obj = model, 
        xname = "x", 
        xvalues = trainingDF$x, 
        yval = trainingDF[[column]], 
        type = "z-scores"
    )
    
    
    # Extract the transformed values
    
    trainingDF <- trainingDF %>%
        select(
            gene, peptide_sequence, !!zColumn
        )
    
    
    # Merge with the saav data frame
    
    saavDF <- saavDF %>%
        left_join(
            trainingDF,
            by = c("gene", "peptide_sequence")
        )
