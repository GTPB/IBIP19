    "Mutations in the genome can alter the sequence so that non-coding sections become coding. _e.g._ through the introduction of a start codon or the alteration of a stop codon. In order to identify these non-canonical genomic products, protein databases that capture genetic variation and non-canonical genomic products are generated either by enriching canonical protein sequences or by running six reading frame translation of the entire genome [(1)](https://gtpb.github.io/IBIP19/pages/proteogenomics/references). \n",
